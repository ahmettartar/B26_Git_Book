2.1. Pulmonary Nodule Database and Imaging Protocol
In the study, dataset containing 95 pulmonary nodules and 75 nonnodules patterns obtained from two-dimensional (2D) CT images from 63 patients
was utilized. The 2D pulmonary nodule patterns are manually marked on CT image by radiologists. Then, the nodule pattern is extracted from the 
CT image as illustrated in Figure 1. Other patterns in the lung parenchyma similar to nodules but not marked as “nodule” by the radiologists are 
selected as the member patterns of nonnodule class. Images are collected from 39 male and 24 female patients whose ages are ranging from 25 to
78 years [mean = 55.4 ± 12.3 years]. The number of pulmonary nodules detected in the right and left lung parenchyma, as illustrated in Figure 2,
is a total of 67 (20 in the upper part, 20 on the bottom part, and 27 pleural cases) and a total of 28 (12 in the upper part, 8 on the bottom part,
8 pleural case), respectively.

The average nodule diameter is 6.42 ± 3.00 mm. The diameter distribution of the nodules used in the database is shown in Figure 3. Also nodule and nonnodule pattern samples used in dataset are given in Figure 4. The age distribution of the patients is illustrated in Figure 5.
